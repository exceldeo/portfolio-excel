    <strong>EFL Acad</strong> is a distinctive and customized web application developed for ITS (Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember) with the primary goal of simplifying the registration process for the ITS English as a Foreign Language (EFL) examination. Leveraging the Laravel framework and a MySQL database, EFL Acad offers a user-friendly and efficient online platform for aspiring exam candidates. This application stands out as a unique solution tailored to meet the precise requirements of ITS. It addresses the specific needs of candidates seeking to register for the EFL examination.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    EFL Acad is designed to empower candidates with a range of essential features, including the ability to view and access the examination schedules, make secure online payments, and provides administrators with robust tools to manage applicant data seamlessly. As a full stack developer, I was an integral part of the development team, contributing to the project's success by ensuring clear and consistent communication with other developers and stakeholders throughout the development process.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    One notable challenge we encountered during the project was the dynamic addition of new features to accommodate the evolving needs of ITS. This required us to maintain the application's flexibility and scalability, which was accomplished through thoughtful architecture and effective collaboration among team members.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    While EFL Acad is a stand-alone project, it serves as a strong example of our capability to create custom web applications to address specific institutional requirements. Its successful development highlights my skills as a full stack developer and my ability to contribute to projects that offer practical and tailored solutions to complex challenges, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.

    The application I developed is called "Exam ITS," and its primary purpose is to facilitate online for Mandiri Test at the Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) and to administer TOEFL exams at ITS. This application was built using the Laravel framework and MySQL as the database technology.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    What sets "Exam ITS" apart from others is its versatility in handling various types of questions, including narrative, audio-based, and multiple-choice questions. This adaptability caters to a wide range of testing needs.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    To address specific needs, the application provides a set of features for different user roles. Participants can take exams online, exam proctors can monitor participants during the tests, and administrators can analyze the results and questions.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    The application is entirely web-based, making it accessible to users through a website.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    I collaborated with a team of developers, and my role was that of a full-stack developer. Our development process was marked by regular communication among team members.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    Key features of "Exam ITS" include the ability to conduct Mandiri Test exams and TOEFL exams for entrance into ITS.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    During development, we faced technical challenges related to the dynamic addition of features as the application evolved. We overcame these challenges by continuously adapting our development process to accommodate these dynamic changes.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    "Exam ITS" serves as a comprehensive online testing platform designed to meet the diverse testing needs of ITS, and it stands out for its adaptability and user-friendly design.
