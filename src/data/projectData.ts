    Siwalan is a multifaceted application encompassing three distinct sub-apps: Siwalan Health, Siwalan Angkot, and Siwalan Wisata. Each of these sub-apps serves a unique purpose, catering to the diverse needs of its users.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    Siwalan Health acts as an intermediary platform that facilitates communication between healthcare providers and patients. It offers features that allow users to consult with doctors, as well as arrange for the delivery of prescribed medications from affiliated pharmacies.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    Siwalan Angkot simplifies the daily commute by providing real-time information on the whereabouts and operating routes of public transportation, specifically the "angkot" (public minivans) in the Tuban area.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    On the other hand, Siwalan Wisata is designed to enhance the recreational experiences of users in Tuban. It enables users to explore and enjoy the beauty of Tuban by offering features such as booking tour packages and hotels in the region.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    What sets Siwalan apart is its ability to seamlessly integrate these three distinct functionalities into a single application. This integration allows users to access healthcare services, plan their commutes, and organize their leisure activities—all from one app. This holistic approach is what makes Siwalan a unique and comprehensive solution.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    To develop the application, our team employed a multi-platform approach. We utilized mobile applications for end-users, doctors, and angkot drivers, while a website was created to cater to the needs of pharmacists and administrators in the tourism sector.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    As a member of the development team, my primary focus was on the Siwalan Health module, ensuring its smooth operation and user-friendly interface. Throughout the development process, effective communication within the team played a crucial role in achieving the final result. We maintained regular contact and coordination, which allowed us to overcome various technical challenges that arose during the dynamic expansion of features.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    Siwalan represents a significant step forward in providing comprehensive solutions for the diverse needs of Tuban's residents and visitors. Its three sub-apps, combined with effective communication within the development team, have culminated in a unique, user-friendly, and multifunctional application.
